## Jacoco plugin

To show testing coverage and generate a report in your Maven project, you can use tools like JaCoCo, which is a popular code coverage library for Java. Hereâ€™s how to integrate JaCoCo into your Maven project:

### 1. Add JaCoCo Plugin to `pom.xml`
First, you need to add the JaCoCo Maven plugin to your `pom.xml` file. Add the following configuration under the `<build>` section:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <!-- JaCoCo plugin -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
            <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.8.8</version> <!-- Use the latest version if available -->
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>prepare-agent</id>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
                <execution>
                    <id>report</id>
                    <phase>prepare-package</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>report</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

### 2. Run Tests and Generate Coverage Report
Once you have added the JaCoCo plugin, you can run your tests and generate the coverage report with the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

This command runs your tests and generates a code coverage report. The report is usually generated in the `target/site/jacoco` directory.

### 3. View the Coverage Report
After running the tests, you can find the HTML report at:

```
target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

Open this file in a web browser to view the code coverage report.

### Summary
1. Add the JaCoCo plugin to your `pom.xml`.
2. Run `mvn clean test` to execute tests and generate coverage.
3. Open the report at `target/site/jacoco/index.html`.

This setup will help you track code coverage and assess how well your tests cover your codebase.

## Jacoco coverage

JaCoCo primarily provides several types of code coverage metrics, including:

### Types of Coverage Provided by JaCoCo

1. **Statement Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of executable statements that have been executed by the tests.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which lines of code have been executed and calculates coverage based on the proportion of executed lines relative to the total number of lines.
   - **Usage**: Helps identify which lines of code are being exercised by your tests.

2. **Branch Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of control flow branches (e.g., if-else branches) that have been executed.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which branches have been taken and calculates coverage based on the proportion of branches executed relative to the total number of branches.
   - **Usage**: Provides insight into how well your tests cover different paths through your code.

3. **Instruction Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of bytecode instructions that have been executed.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which bytecode instructions have been executed and calculates coverage based on the proportion of executed instructions relative to the total number of instructions.
   - **Usage**: Offers a finer level of detail than statement coverage, focusing on the actual bytecode instructions executed.

4. **Method Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of methods that have been called by the tests.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which methods have been invoked and calculates coverage based on the proportion of invoked methods relative to the total number of methods.
   - **Usage**: Provides insight into which methods are being tested.

5. **Class Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of classes that have been instantiated or used by the tests.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which classes have been involved in the test execution and calculates coverage based on the proportion of classes involved relative to the total number of classes.
   - **Usage**: Helps identify which classes are being tested.

### Detailed Coverage Metrics

JaCoCo generates detailed reports that include various metrics:

- **Line Coverage**: The percentage of lines of code executed.
- **Branch Coverage**: The percentage of decision points or branches covered.
- **Complexity Metrics**: In some reports, complexity metrics such as cyclomatic complexity might be included to assess code complexity.

### Coverage Calculation Process

1. **Instrumentation**: JaCoCo instruments the bytecode of your classes to add hooks for tracking execution. This process involves adding code to measure which parts of the code are executed during test runs.

2. **Execution Monitoring**: During test execution, JaCoCo collects data on which parts of the instrumented code are hit.

3. **Data Aggregation**: After tests are complete, JaCoCo aggregates the coverage data and computes the coverage metrics based on the collected execution data.

4. **Report Generation**: JaCoCo generates coverage reports in various formats (HTML, XML, CSV) that visualize the coverage metrics, helping you identify which parts of your codebase are well-tested and which are not.

### Example JaCoCo Report

A JaCoCo report will typically show:
- **Coverage Percentage**: Overall percentage of code coverage.
- **Detailed Coverage Information**: Breakdown by classes, methods, and lines.
- **Coverage Gaps**: Sections of code that were not covered by tests.

### Summary

JaCoCo provides coverage metrics primarily focused on:
- **Statement Coverage**: Lines of code executed.
- **Branch Coverage**: Execution of control flow branches.
- **Instruction Coverage**: Bytecode instructions executed.
- **Method and Class Coverage**: Coverage of methods and classes.

These metrics help in assessing the quality and completeness of tests, guiding improvements in your test suite.
