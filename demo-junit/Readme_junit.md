## mvn cheatsheet

Here's a cheatsheet for common Maven commands and operations. This should help you quickly reference the most commonly used `mvn` commands.

### New project

  ```bash
  mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
  ```

### Maven Build Lifecycle Phases
Maven has a predefined build lifecycle with various phases:

- **validate**: Validates the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
- **compile**: Compiles the source code of the project.
- **test**: Runs the tests using a suitable unit testing framework (e.g., JUnit).
- **package**: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).
- **verify**: Runs any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
- **install**: Installs the package into the local repository, making it available for other projects on the same machine.
- **deploy**: Copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

### Basic Commands

- **Build the project** (executes `validate`, `compile`, `test`, `package`):
  ```bash
  mvn package
  ```

- **Compile the project**:
  ```bash
  mvn compile
  ```

- **Clean the project** (removes the `target/` directory):
  ```bash
  mvn clean
  ```

- **Clean and then build the project**:
  ```bash
  mvn clean package
  ```

- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

- **Install the package into the local repository**:
  ```bash
  mvn install
  ```

- **Deploy the package to a remote repository**:
  ```bash
  mvn deploy
  ```

### Running Specific Phases or Goals

- **Run only the `test` phase**:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

- **Skip tests during the build**:
  ```bash
  mvn install -DskipTests
  ```

- **Compile without running tests**:
  ```bash
  mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  ```

- **Run a specific test class**:
  ```bash
  mvn -Dtest=ClassName test
  ```

- **Run a specific test method in a class**:
  ```bash
  mvn -Dtest=ClassName#methodName test
  ```

### Dependency Management

- **Download dependencies**:
  ```bash
  mvn dependency:resolve
  ```

- **Display dependency tree**:
  ```bash
  mvn dependency:tree
  ```

- **Analyze and list all dependencies**:
  ```bash
  mvn dependency:list
  ```

### Project Information

- **Display project information**:
  ```bash
  mvn help:effective-pom
  ```

- **Display list of available goals**:
  ```bash
  mvn help:describe -Dcmd=help
  ```

- **Show details of a specific goal**:
  ```bash
  mvn help:describe -Dmojo=<plugin-goal> -Ddetail
  ```

### Profiles

- **Activate a profile**:
  ```bash
  mvn <goal> -PprofileName
  ```

- **List available profiles**:
  ```bash
  mvn help:all-profiles
  ```

### Archetypes

- **Generate a new project from an archetype**:
  ```bash
  mvn archetype:generate
  ```

### Clean Up

- **Purge local repository of unneeded files**:
  ```bash
  mvn dependency:purge-local-repository
  ```

### Debugging

- **Enable debug output**:
  ```bash
  mvn <goal> -X
  ```

- **Enable batch mode (non-interactive)**:
  ```bash
  mvn <goal> -B
  ```

This cheatsheet should cover the most common tasks you'll perform with Maven. Let me know if you need any further details or specific examples!
## Install Maven in VS code

To create a Maven project using the Command Line Interface (CLI) in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

### 1. **Install Maven (if not already installed)**

First, ensure that Maven is installed on your system:

- **macOS**: Maven might already be installed. You can check by running:
  ```bash
  mvn -v
  ```
  If Maven isn't installed, you can install it via Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install maven
  ```

- **Windows**: You can download and install Maven from the [Apache Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

- **Linux**: Install Maven using your package manager:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install maven
  ```

### 2. **Open Terminal in Visual Studio Code**

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the integrated terminal by navigating to `View` > `Terminal` or using the shortcut `` Ctrl + ` ``.

### 3. **Create a Maven Project**

In the terminal, use the following command to create a new Maven project:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

- **`-DgroupId=com.example`**: Specifies the group ID for your project (usually a domain name in reverse).
- **`-DartifactId=my-app`**: Specifies the artifact ID, which is the name of your project.
- **`-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart`**: Specifies the archetype to use for generating the project (in this case, a simple Java project).
- **`-DinteractiveMode=false`**: Runs the command non-interactively.

### 4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

After running the command, a new directory with the name of your project (`my-app`) will be created. Navigate into this directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

### 5. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**

You can open the newly created Maven project in Visual Studio Code with the following command:

```bash
code .
```

This command opens the current directory as a project in Visual Studio Code.

### 6. **Build the Project**

To build the project, you can run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command will compile the project, run any tests, and package the application.

### 7. **Run the Project**

To run the generated project (if it has a `main` method), use:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.App"
```

Replace `"com.example.App"` with the correct package and class name that contains the `main` method.

### 8. **Edit and Manage the Project in VS Code**

Now you can edit your project files, manage dependencies in the `pom.xml`, and use the integrated terminal in VS Code for Maven commands.

This setup allows you to create and manage Maven projects directly from the CLI in Visual Studio Code.

## Plugin configuration

### Setting Plugin Execution in a Maven Lifecycle

In Maven, you can control when a plugin is executed during the build lifecycle by configuring the plugin in the `pom.xml`. For example, if you want to integrate JaCoCo, a popular code coverage tool, and ensure it runs during the `test` phase of the build lifecycle, you'll specify this in your `pom.xml`.

### Extending the POM Introduction: Plugin Configuration

To set the execution of a plugin in a specific lifecycle phase, you need to add the plugin to the `<build>` section of your `pom.xml` and specify the desired execution phase.

#### Example: Configuring JaCoCo Plugin to Run During the `test` Phase

Hereâ€™s how you can configure the JaCoCo Maven plugin to execute during the `test` phase:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                             http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <!-- Project coordinates -->
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>

    <!-- Dependencies -->
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.13.2</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <!-- Build configurations -->
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <!-- JaCoCo Plugin -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
                <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>0.8.8</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                    <execution>
                        <id>report</id>
                        <phase>test</phase> <!-- Bind the execution to the 'test' phase -->
                        <goals>
                            <goal>report</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>

            <!-- Compiler Plugin -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>1.8</source>
                    <target>1.8</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

Breakdown of the Configuration:

1. **Plugin Declaration**:
   - The JaCoCo plugin is added under the `<plugins>` section within the `<build>` section.

2. **Executions**:
   - The `<executions>` tag allows you to define multiple execution configurations for the plugin.

3. **Goals**:
   - In this example, the JaCoCo plugin is configured with two goals:
     - **prepare-agent**: This goal prepares the agent that will monitor the execution of the tests. This is executed during the default phase associated with the goal.
     - **report**: This goal generates the code coverage report. It is explicitly bound to the `test` phase using the `<phase>` tag.

4. **Binding to a Lifecycle Phase**:
   - By specifying `<phase>test</phase>` within the `<execution>` block, you bind the execution of the `report` goal to the `test` phase of the Maven lifecycle. This means that the coverage report will be generated immediately after the tests are run.

### Executing the Lifecycle with Plugin Configurations

Once you have configured the plugin as shown above, you can simply run:

```bash
mvn test
```

This command will:

- Compile your code.
- Run your tests.
- Generate a JaCoCo coverage report during the `test` phase.

### Customizing Execution Phases

You can bind plugin executions to other phases as well, depending on your needs. For example:

- **pre-clean**: Execute before cleaning the project.
- **compile**: Execute after compiling the code.
- **package**: Execute when packaging the project.

#### Example: Running JaCoCo During the `verify` Phase

```xml
<execution>
    <id>report</id>
    <phase>verify</phase> <!-- Bind the execution to the 'verify' phase -->
    <goals>
        <goal>report</goal>
    </goals>
</execution>
```

This change would delay the generation of the JaCoCo report until after all tests have been verified.

### Best Practices for Plugin Configuration

- **Define Default Goals**: Use default goals when possible to keep your `pom.xml` clean.
- **Use Profiles for Conditional Executions**: If you need different plugin behaviors in different environments (e.g., development vs. production), consider using profiles.
- **Avoid Over-configuration**: Only configure whatâ€™s necessary to avoid complexity.

### Conclusion

By carefully configuring plugins in your `pom.xml`, you can fully control the build process, ensuring that tasks like code coverage, testing, and packaging happen exactly when you need them to. The `pom.xml` thus becomes a powerful tool for orchestrating complex builds and ensuring consistency across different environments.

## POM and Junit 5

The POM file

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>fcu</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-junit01</artifactId>
  <packaging>jar</packaging>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <name>my-junit01</name>
  <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>
  <dependencies>
    <!-- JUnit 5 dependency -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
      <version>5.9.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>

```

The testing code
```java
package fcu;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

/**
 * Unit test for simple App.
 */
public class AppTest {

    /**
     * Rigorous Test :-)
     */
    @Test
    public void testApp() {
        assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

### Junit 5 dependencies
The dependency you've added for JUnit 5 (`junit-jupiter`) is sufficient for most cases. The `junit-jupiter` artifact is a meta-dependency that includes the following components:

- `junit-jupiter-api` (the API for writing tests)
- `junit-jupiter-engine` (the test engine to run the tests)
- `junit-jupiter-params` (for parameterized tests)

So, by including `junit-jupiter`, you automatically get both `junit-jupiter-api` and `junit-jupiter-engine`, along with the other components of JUnit 5.

You do **not** need to explicitly add `junit-jupiter-api` and `junit-jupiter-engine` separately unless you have a specific reason to manage these components individually.

Here's your dependency block as it stands:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- JUnit 5 dependency -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
        <version>5.9.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
### Junit 5 API/Engine

In JUnit 5, the terms "API" and "Engine" refer to different components that serve distinct purposes within the testing framework:

**JUnit Jupiter API (`junit-jupiter-api`)**
- **Purpose**: This module provides the public API for writing tests. It includes annotations, assertions, and other utilities that you use when writing test cases.
- **Contents**: 
  - **Annotations**: Like `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`, etc.
  - **Assertions**: Like `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertThrows`, etc.
  - **Other Utilities**: Classes and interfaces to support parameterized tests, test lifecycle management, and more.
- **Usage**: This is the library you interact with directly when creating test cases in JUnit 5. For instance, when you write a test method annotated with `@Test`, you're using the JUnit Jupiter API.

**JUnit Jupiter Engine (`junit-jupiter-engine`)**
- **Purpose**: This module is the runtime component that discovers and executes tests written using the JUnit Jupiter API. It integrates with test runners or build tools to actually run the tests.
- **Contents**: 
  - **Test Engine Implementation**: The code that runs the tests, manages test discovery, and handles execution logic.
  - **Integration with Build Tools**: The engine ensures that tools like Maven, Gradle, or IDEs (like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code) can run JUnit 5 tests.
- **Usage**: The engine is not something you interact with directly. Instead, it's used behind the scenes when you run your tests, ensuring they are executed according to the rules defined in the JUnit Jupiter API.

**Summary**
- **JUnit Jupiter API (`junit-jupiter-api`)**: The "what" of testing. It defines the structure, annotations, and assertions you use to write tests.
- **JUnit Jupiter Engine (`junit-jupiter-engine`)**: The "how" of testing. It finds and runs the tests you wrote using the API.

Both components are necessary for running JUnit 5 tests: the API allows you to write them, and the engine makes sure they are executed correctly.

### Compile partial files

In a Maven project, if you want to temporarily exclude certain files or directories from being compiled, you can do so by configuring the `maven-compiler-plugin` in your `pom.xml`. Here's how you can set it up:

#### 1. Exclude Specific Files or Directories
To exclude specific files or directories from being compiled, you can add an `excludes` section to the `maven-compiler-plugin` configuration.


```xml
<project>
    <!-- Other configurations -->
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <excludes>
                        <!-- Exclude specific files -->
                        <exclude>**/path/to/excluded/File1.java</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/path/to/excluded/File2.java</exclude>
                        <!-- Exclude entire directories -->
                        <exclude>**/path/to/excluded/directory/**</exclude>
                    </excludes>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

- **`<exclude>`**: Defines the files or directories to be excluded. The patterns are relative to the `src/main/java` or `src/test/java` directories by default.
- **Wildcard usage**:
  - `**/` matches directories at any level.
  - `*.java` matches any Java file.
  - `**/directory/**` matches all files within the specified directory.

#### 2. Temporarily Exclude Files

If you want to temporarily exclude files, you can simply comment out or remove the `excludes` section when you want to include those files again.

#### 3. Excluding Test Files

If you want to exclude test files in `src/test/java`, you can configure the `maven-surefire-plugin` in a similar way:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.22.2</version>
            <configuration>
                <excludes>
                    <exclude>**/path/to/excluded/TestFile1.java</exclude>
                    <exclude>**/path/to/excluded/TestFile2.java</exclude>
                </excludes>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

#### 4. **Alternative: Moving Files Temporarily**

Another approach is to temporarily move the files you don't want to compile to a different directory outside of the `src/main/java` or `src/test/java` structure. Maven will not compile files that are not within these directories.

#### 5. **Reverting the Changes**

To revert the exclusion, simply remove or comment out the `excludes` configuration in the `pom.xml`, or move the files back to their original location if you chose to move them.

By using the `excludes` section in your Maven configuration, you can easily manage which files are included in the build process, allowing you to focus on specific parts of your project without permanently altering your codebase.

## Junt testing



## Jacoco plugin

To show testing coverage and generate a report in your Maven project, you can use tools like JaCoCo, which is a popular code coverage library for Java. Hereâ€™s how to integrate JaCoCo into your Maven project:

### 1. Add JaCoCo Plugin to `pom.xml`
First, you need to add the JaCoCo Maven plugin to your `pom.xml` file. Add the following configuration under the `<build>` section:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <!-- JaCoCo plugin -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
            <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.8.8</version> <!-- Use the latest version if available -->
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>prepare-agent</id>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
                <execution>
                    <id>report</id>
                    <phase>prepare-package</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>report</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

### 2. Run Tests and Generate Coverage Report
Once you have added the JaCoCo plugin, you can run your tests and generate the coverage report with the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

This command runs your tests and generates a code coverage report. The report is usually generated in the `target/site/jacoco` directory.

### 3. View the Coverage Report
After running the tests, you can find the HTML report at:

```
target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

Open this file in a web browser to view the code coverage report.

### Summary
1. Add the JaCoCo plugin to your `pom.xml`.
2. Run `mvn clean test` to execute tests and generate coverage.
3. Open the report at `target/site/jacoco/index.html`.

This setup will help you track code coverage and assess how well your tests cover your codebase.

## Jacoco coverage
JaCoCo primarily provides several types of code coverage metrics, including:

### Types of Coverage Provided by JaCoCo

1. **Statement Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of executable statements that have been executed by the tests.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which lines of code have been executed and calculates coverage based on the proportion of executed lines relative to the total number of lines.
   - **Usage**: Helps identify which lines of code are being exercised by your tests.

2. **Branch Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of control flow branches (e.g., if-else branches) that have been executed.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which branches have been taken and calculates coverage based on the proportion of branches executed relative to the total number of branches.
   - **Usage**: Provides insight into how well your tests cover different paths through your code.

3. **Instruction Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of bytecode instructions that have been executed.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which bytecode instructions have been executed and calculates coverage based on the proportion of executed instructions relative to the total number of instructions.
   - **Usage**: Offers a finer level of detail than statement coverage, focusing on the actual bytecode instructions executed.

4. **Method Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of methods that have been called by the tests.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which methods have been invoked and calculates coverage based on the proportion of invoked methods relative to the total number of methods.
   - **Usage**: Provides insight into which methods are being tested.

5. **Class Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Measures the percentage of classes that have been instantiated or used by the tests.
   - **Calculation**: JaCoCo tracks which classes have been involved in the test execution and calculates coverage based on the proportion of classes involved relative to the total number of classes.
   - **Usage**: Helps identify which classes are being tested.

### Detailed Coverage Metrics

JaCoCo generates detailed reports that include various metrics:

- **Line Coverage**: The percentage of lines of code executed.
- **Branch Coverage**: The percentage of decision points or branches covered.
- **Complexity Metrics**: In some reports, complexity metrics such as cyclomatic complexity might be included to assess code complexity.

### Coverage Calculation Process

1. **Instrumentation**: JaCoCo instruments the bytecode of your classes to add hooks for tracking execution. This process involves adding code to measure which parts of the code are executed during test runs.

2. **Execution Monitoring**: During test execution, JaCoCo collects data on which parts of the instrumented code are hit.

3. **Data Aggregation**: After tests are complete, JaCoCo aggregates the coverage data and computes the coverage metrics based on the collected execution data.

4. **Report Generation**: JaCoCo generates coverage reports in various formats (HTML, XML, CSV) that visualize the coverage metrics, helping you identify which parts of your codebase are well-tested and which are not.

### Example JaCoCo Report

A JaCoCo report will typically show:
- **Coverage Percentage**: Overall percentage of code coverage.
- **Detailed Coverage Information**: Breakdown by classes, methods, and lines.
- **Coverage Gaps**: Sections of code that were not covered by tests.

### Summary

JaCoCo provides coverage metrics primarily focused on:
- **Statement Coverage**: Lines of code executed.
- **Branch Coverage**: Execution of control flow branches.
- **Instruction Coverage**: Bytecode instructions executed.
- **Method and Class Coverage**: Coverage of methods and classes.

These metrics help in assessing the quality and completeness of tests, guiding improvements in your test suite.
